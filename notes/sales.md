## Strategies

### Targets
- IT Dept at large corp (i.e. Giant Eagle)
- Software consulting companies (i.e. Build in Motion)
- college professors (maybe)
- anybody doing DevOps

### Benefits
- share knowledge across team, make juniors(/students?) more productive
- eliminate bus-factor
- speed up fire fighting
- standardize ways of doing things on command line
- (consulting) ship coach.db with open source coach as deliverable as way to deliver scripts to maintain new software
- avoid trips to StackOverflow/Google

### Proposed Features
- alerts when specified commands are run
- central server
- identify multi-line repetitions
- directory map (alias important directorys)
- pre and post append/run scripts
- better windows support (track history in PowerShell and regular command line if desired)

### Website dev build sales
- offer dev build for $20 (less than the cost of a nice meal)
- offer an updated build every time a survey is filled out

### Survey questions
- how long have you been using the product
- how many scripts have you saved
- how many times have you had to look at a man page/stackoverflow when performing devops tasks
- what do you like most about using coach
- what do you wish coach could do

### Conversations
- Ben Williams really liked the tool for the querying capabilities which he saw as empowering to junior members of the team.
    He committed to showing his boss and requesting for me to give a demo to his boss. 

## TO DO
- write blog post demonstrating how I used coach to build the marketing site
