## Strategies

### Targets
- IT Dept at large corp (i.e. Giant Eagle)
- Software consulting comapnies (i.e. Build in Motion)
- college professors (maybe)
- anybody doing DevOps

### Benefits
- share knowledge across team, make juniors(/students?) more productive
- eliminate bus-factor
- standardize ways of doing things on command line
- (consulting) ship coach.db as deliverable as way to disover scripts to maintain new software
- avoid trips to StackOverflow/Google

### Proposed Features
- alerts when specified commands are run
- central server
- identify multi-line repetitions
- directory map (alias important directorys)
- ignore all variations of commands if not compound (cd, cat, ls, etc.)
- script agnostic way of getting runtime variables
- pre and post append/run scripts
