package coach

/*
Coach helps you document Ops processes by recording all of your commands and prompting
you to describe the purpose and goals behind running frequently run commands.  This
documentation can then be queried later on the command line.  Coach will also identify
important directories on the machine.

This should ensure that frequent management tasks are well understood by everyone on
the team.
